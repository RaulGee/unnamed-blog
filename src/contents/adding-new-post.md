Netlify is a popular cloud hosting platform that can be used to deploy static websites, and is becoming increasingly popular among developers and businesses alike. In this post, I'll show you how to deploy a static site to Netlify in just a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Create a Repository

The first thing you'll need to do is create a repository for your static site on a Git repository hosting platform like GitHub or Bitbucket. If you don't already have a repository, create a new one and push your static site files to it.

## Step 2: Sign up for Netlify

Next, sign up for a free account on Netlify if you haven't already. Once you're logged in, you'll see a button that says "New site from Git". Click it and you'll be prompted to select the repository that you just created.

## Step 3: Configure Site Settings

After selecting your repository, Netlify will automatically detect the build command and publish directory for your static site. You can change these settings if necessary, but the defaults should work for most static sites.

## Step 4: Deploy Your Site

Once you've configured your site settings, click "Deploy site" to deploy your site to Netlify. Depending on the size of your site, this may take a few minutes. Once the deployment is complete, you'll see a URL for your site.

## Step 5: Test Your Site

Click on the URL to test your site and make sure everything is working correctly. If you encounter any issues, go back and check your site settings and ensure that your files are properly configured.

## Step 6: Configure Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in Netlify's settings. Click on "Domain settings" and enter your custom domain. Follow the instructions provided by Netlify to configure your domain's DNS settings.

## Step 7: Redeploy Your Site

If you make any changes to your site files, you'll need to redeploy your site to Netlify. To do this, simply push the changes to your Git repository, and Netlify will automatically redeploy your site.

## Conclusion

Deploying a static site to Netlify is a quick and easy process that can be done in just a few simple steps. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you'll be able to deploy your static site to Netlify and have it up and running in no time.
